Lets us check for collisions with pixels.  One version for web one for native 
linux and windows
Must add the following to Cargo.toml

# Conditionally include Rayon only for native platforms (not Wasm)
rayon = { version = "1.7", optional = true }
[features]
default = ["native"]  # Default feature includes "native"
native = ["rayon"]    # The "native" feature enables Rayon
[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]
rayon = "1.7"  # Rayon is only included for native builds

In your mod.rs file located in the modules folder add the following to the end of the file:
    pub mod collision;
Then in with the other use command add:

use crate::modules::collision::check_collision;
 
Then in the loop you would use the follow to check if two images hit: 
let collision = check_collision(&img1, &img2, 1); //Where 1 is the number of pixels to skip
    if collision {
        println!("Collision detected!");
    } else {
        println!("No collision.");
    }
*/
